# Unicity State Transition SDK — Rust

Build applications that mint, transfer, and verify digital assets on the Unicity Network. This Rust SDK gives you control over tokens, ownership rules, and payments, with cryptographic verification built in.

Unicity combines private, off-chain token transactions with network-backed protection against double-spending. Token data stays with the parties you share it with, while unicity proofs let recipients verify that assets are spent only once. The network is designed to scale horizontally as demand grows.

- **Create digital assets:** mint tokens with your own types and application data payload.
- **Move value:** transfer tokens and split fungible tokens for payments.
- **Verify locally:** validate token history and unicity proofs against the compact trust base.
- **Integrate with your application:** choose ownership predicates, issuance policies, storage, and delivery channels.
- **Use Rust across environments:** use the HTTP client in host applications or the `no_std` verification core in WASM and zkVM guests.

## Installation

Requires Rust 1.81 or later. Add the SDK with its HTTP client to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
unicity-token = { version = "0.1", features = ["http"] }
```

## Unicity Network

Mainnet is live. Start with testnet2; for production, use the mainnet gateway and matching trust base.

| Network | Gateway | Network ID | Trust base |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mainnet | `https://gateway.mainnet.unicity.network` | `1` | [JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unicitynetwork/unicity-ids/main/bft-trustbase.mainnet.json) |
| Testnet2 | `https://gateway.testnet2.unicity.network` | `4` | [JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unicitynetwork/unicity-ids/main/bft-trustbase.testnet2.json) |

Pass your gateway API key through `HttpAggregatorClient::with_api_key`. The public testnet2 key is `sk_ddc3cfcc001e4a28ac3fad7407f99590`. Use your own mainnet key obtained from [Sphere](https://sphere.unicity.network/) and keep it secure.

### Client setup

Download the testnet2 trust base above as `bft-trustbase.testnet2.json` in your working directory. Configure the client and load the trust base:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use unicity_token::api::bft::RootTrustBase;
use unicity_token::client::HttpAggregatorClient;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let trust_base = RootTrustBase::from_json(
        &std::fs::read_to_string("bft-trustbase.testnet2.json")?,
    )?;
    let _aggregator = HttpAggregatorClient::new(
        "https://gateway.testnet2.unicity.network",
    )
    .with_api_key("sk_ddc3cfcc001e4a28ac3fad7407f99590") // Public testnet2 key
    .with_polling(Duration::from_secs(2), 90);

    println!("Network ID: {}", trust_base.network_id.id());
    Ok(())
}
```

The trust base identifies the Consensus Layer (BFT Core) instance. Pin a trusted copy in your application for production. Use `trust_base.network_id` when creating tokens so they match your gateway; testnet2 is network ID `4` (`NetworkId::TESTNET` is `2`).

`HttpAggregatorClient` provides a blocking HTTP transport. Applications can implement the `AggregatorClient` trait to supply their own transport.

## Working with tokens

The SDK handles cryptography and token encoding. Your application manages keys, stores tokens, and delivers them to recipients over your chosen transport.

| Task | SDK entry points | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mint a token | `client::mint` | [Mint](./examples/mint.rs) |
| Transfer ownership | `client::transfer` | [Transfer](./examples/transfer.rs) |
| Split a fungible token | `payment::TokenSplit::split` | [Split](./examples/split.rs) |
| Verify a payment token | `payment::verify_payment_token` | [Payment verification](./examples/split.rs) |

`client::mint` and `client::transfer` submit the transaction, wait for its unicity proof (`InclusionProof` in the API), and return the verified token. The [split example](./examples/split.rs) includes payment verifier setup.

### Store, send, and receive

Serialize with `token.to_cbor()` to save or send a token, and deserialize with `Token::from_cbor(bytes)` to load it. Verify received tokens before accepting them:

```rust
use unicity_token::Token;

// `token_bytes` comes from your storage or transport.
let token = Token::from_cbor(&token_bytes)?;
token.verify(&trust_base)?;
```

`Token::verify` checks cryptographic history; application data remains opaque. Use `Token::verify_with` for registered mint justifications and `payment::verify_payment_token` for payments.

### Run the examples

From a repository checkout, set the public testnet2 key and run a flow:

```bash
export UNICITY_API_KEY=sk_ddc3cfcc001e4a28ac3fad7407f99590
cargo run --example mint --features http
cargo run --example transfer --features http
cargo run --example split --features http
```

The examples default to testnet2 with its bundled trust base. Configure `UNICITY_GATEWAY`, `UNICITY_API_KEY`, and `UNICITY_TRUSTBASE` through your environment or `e2e/.env`; relative trust-base paths resolve under `e2e/`. Example keys are discarded on exit. See [example configuration](./examples/README.md).

## Security

Unicity proofs provide independently verifiable evidence of certified state transitions being unique, backed by the network's Byzantine fault tolerant consensus. Together with ownership verification, they protect against double-spending without publishing token contents to a public ledger.

Verify tokens against the correct trust base and configure accepted issuers through `PaymentDataVerifier` and `MintJustificationRegistry`. Cryptographic validity does not authorize an issuer. Keep private keys and token backups secure, and check that received tokens belong to the intended recipient.

## Feature flags

| Feature | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alloc` | Via `std` and `client` | Allocated structures used by the verification core. |
| `std` | Yes | Standard library integration, key generation, and JSON trust-base parsing. |
| `client` | Yes | Transaction construction, signing, minting, transfers, and split construction. |
| `http` | No | Blocking HTTP client for host applications. Enables `std` and `client`. |

For verification in a `no_std` environment, including WASM and zkVM guests:

```toml
[dependencies]
unicity-token = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["alloc"] }
```

Token and payment verification remain available in this configuration. Construct the trust base with `RootTrustBase::try_new`; JSON parsing requires `std`.

## Development

```bash
cargo test
cargo test --all-features
cargo test --no-default-features --features alloc
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

The [live end-to-end test](./tests/e2e.rs) is ignored by default. It reads gateway credentials from `e2e/unicity-service` and uses `e2e/bft-trustbase.testnet2.json`:

```bash
cargo test --features http --test e2e -- --ignored --nocapture
```
